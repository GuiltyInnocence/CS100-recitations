# CS100-recitations
Based on GKxx's slides, modified to fit my own recitation.

Except Recitation9, this is my own work since I am responsible for that.

Materials for CS100 recitations.

The recitation slides are written in $\LaTeX$ beamer.

You can add the `[handout]` option to the document-class to ignore all the `\pause`s.
